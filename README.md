ChatWorld Instruction Guide

This project has dependecies that must be installed before running
You must download panda3d from https://www.panda3d.org/download.php
You must download mongodb from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
You must pip install SpeechRecognition

Once these have been installed, the application can be started by running the 'run' file. 

A few notes:
The run function starts two clients on one computer.
The code assumes that there are 2 microphones connected. 
If only one microphone is connected, the application terminates.

That's it, enjoy!
