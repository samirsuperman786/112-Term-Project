This project has dependecies that must be installed before running  
You must download panda3d from https://www.panda3d.org/download.php  
You must download and set up mongodb from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/  
You must pip install SpeechRecognition  

Once these have been installed, the application can be started by running the 'run' file.   

A few notes:  
The run function by default starts two clients on one computer.  
Modify the run file if you need only one client.
The application uses multiple microphones if multiple clients are running on one computer.   

That's it, enjoy!
